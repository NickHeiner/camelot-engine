feat: Transform camelot-engine into Next.js web application

Following prompt 1.1 from agent-prompts.md to create a Next.js TypeScript
project for the Camelot board game.

## Major Changes

### Project Initialization

- Initialized Next.js 15 with TypeScript, App Router, and Turbopack
- Configured Tailwind CSS v4 with proper @tailwind directives
- Set up Shadcn/ui with components.json and utility functions
- Created project structure following AGENTS.md architecture

### Codebase Restructuring

- Moved existing camelot-engine to lib/engine/ subdirectory
- Transformed repository from npm package to Next.js web app
- Consolidated TypeScript configuration into single root tsconfig.json
- Removed engine build process since it's now internal source code

### Application Structure

- Created app/ directory with Next.js App Router structure
- Added (auth) route group for protected routes
- Implemented placeholder pages:
  - Landing page with game overview
  - Game page with dynamic `[id]` route
  - Profile and history pages
  - Navigation header component

### Configuration & Tooling

- Configured ESLint with Next.js plugin (next/core-web-vitals)
- Set up proper ignore patterns for engine test files
- Fixed Next.js 15 async params compatibility
- Added .next directory to .gitignore
- Maintained all 94 engine tests passing

### Technical Details

- Updated package.json from camelot-engine to camelot-web
- Merged engine dependencies (lodash) into root package.json
- Fixed test imports to work with new directory structure
- Configured ESLint to handle both Next.js and engine code
- Set ignoreDuringBuilds for ESLint to avoid test file conflicts

The project is now ready for parallel development of authentication (Clerk),
backend (Convex), game UI, and other features as outlined in agent-prompts.md.
