You're on a branch from another coding agent. It's partially complete, but you need to verify that everything is working, and/or do what that agent couldn't. Finish it.

Run these two commands to get a sense of what the previous agent was doing: 
* `git --no-pager diff (git merge-base master HEAD)..HEAD`
* `git --no-pager log master..HEAD --pretty=%B --no-merges`

Then, run `npm test` to see if the previous agent left you with a mess.
