I'll give you a branch from another coding agent. It's partially complete, but you need to verify that everything is working, and/or do what that agent couldn't. Finish it.

<steps>
  <step>
  `git fetch origin`
  `git checkout {the branch name I gave you}`
  </step>
  <step>
  Run these two commands to get a sense of what the previous agent was doing: 
  * `git --no-pager diff (git merge-base master HEAD)..HEAD`
  * `git --no-pager log master..HEAD --pretty=%B --no-merges`
  </step>
  <step>
  Run `npm test` to see if the previous agent left you with a mess.  
  </step>
  <step>
  Pull in the latest changes from `origin`. 

  `git fetch origin master`

  `git pull --rebase origin master`, or if the conflicts are hard to resolve on that, try `git merge origin/master`.
  </step>
  <step>
  `npm test`
  </step>
  <step>
  Manually use the webapp to see if it worked.
  </step>
</steps>
