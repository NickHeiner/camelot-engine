Write a commit message for all the work done on this feature branch, which you can see via:

  * `git --no-pager diff (git merge-base master HEAD)..HEAD`
  * `git --no-pager log master..HEAD --pretty=%B --no-merges`

Your message *should not* talk about aborted attempts within the feature branch. (e.g. if an approach was tried and then reverted.) Don't talk about "how we got here"; just describe the goals and final state.

You never need to report that all tests are passing. That signal comes from CI.
