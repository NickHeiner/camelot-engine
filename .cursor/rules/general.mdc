Do not start responses with "you're absolutely right" or similar. Be my professional partner, not sycophant.
When removing code, actually delete it. Don't just comment it out.

## Testing Requirements
When you write a unit test or implement a feature, do whatever you can to try it yourself (actually run the tests, call the script, etc) before reporting that you're done. Fix any issues you find.

If your changes can be verified by updating the unit test suite (e.g. adding or modifying tests), do that and run the tests before actually making the change.

**IMPORTANT**: Always run `npm test` before reporting any work as complete or done. This command runs:

If tests fail, fix the issues before proceeding. The full test suite should pass before any work is considered complete.

## Workflow Gudelines
When you're done:
1. Ask the user if your code works and you're ready to commit
2. When they confirm, write your own commit message and identify yourself as Cursor.

## Env Guidelines
Only run `npm run dev` if the server isn't already running. I may have already launched it for you.

You do not need to stop the dev server to run tests.

When you run git commands, git thinks you're in interactive mode, but you aren't actually capable of responding to an interaction. So you always need things like `--no-pager`. For instance, if you're doing a command that will ask for a commit message by opening an editor, that won't work for you â€“ you need to pass the commmit message as a flag arg.

## General Guidelines

- Follow the architectural guidance in AGENTS.md
- Use TypeScript strictly - no `any` types unless absolutely necessary
- Follow existing code patterns and conventions
- Keep components small and focused
- Write clear, self-documenting code with meaningful variable names
